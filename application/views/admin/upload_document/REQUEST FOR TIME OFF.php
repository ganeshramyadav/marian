<p>Electronic Signature Policy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Policy:</u></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this policy is to utilize current technology in the provision of patient care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>(Lifelink Health Providers, Inc</u></em><u>.)</u>employees, contractors and physicians may use electronic signatures on authorized computer generated documentation.&nbsp; An electronic signature shall serve as authentication on <strong><u>Patient Record Documents AND Human Resource Documents</u></strong> generated in an electronic system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Procedure:</u></p>
<ol>
<li><em><u>(Lifelink Health Providers, Inc.)</u></em>employees, contractors and physicians may create patient and human resource documentation via computer system.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Each user shall be provided training on the policies and procedures of electronic signatures.</li>
<li>&nbsp;For the purpose of the electronic medical record and human resource record documents printed from the electronic medical record and human resources record, the employee&rsquo;s use of a signature password after authenticating with their system password shall serve as their legal signature.</li>
<li>A signature password shall be generated by the employee, contractor or physician and shall only be accessible to them.</li>
<li>Each user shall be required to change their password</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>upon a password being reset by an agency administrator</li>
<li>every &lt;60&gt; days</li>
<li>at the employee&rsquo;s discretion after prior authorization from the administrator</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Each user must keep their login username/ password and signature password secret; and only administrators may reset a user password.</li>
<li>If a signature password must be reset, then the employee, contractor or physician must submit a request to the agency with authentication information to reset the signature password.</li>
<li>Each user shall report a breach of password or unknown application of electronic signature to appropriate administrative staff.</li>
<li>After clinical review or HR record review each document submitted by a clinician shall be returned to the clinician for electronic signature. When the document is signed, it shall at that point become part of the electronic medical record or HR electronic record.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Each employee, contractor or physician documenting electronically in the electronic medical record and HR electronic record shall be required to sign an electronic signature authenticity agreement. The agreement shall require that they:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Never share their login username / password or their signature password with anyone.</li>
<li>Exit the electronic medical record software at the end of each working day, and when the computer shall not be used for clinical documentation.</li>
<li>Review all documentation prior to submission.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Each employee shall review documentation and make needed corrections to documents returned by a Case Manager or HR Director.</li>
<li>In the event of a system outage that prohibits electronically signed documents, documents shall be produced manually.</li>
<li>Upon termination of employment; the administrator shall immediately disable the employee, contractor or physician credentials needed to access all organizational electronic records.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><u>ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE AUTHENTICITY AGREEMENT</u></p>
<p><u>&nbsp;</u></p>
<p>I, ________________________________________________, understand that <em><u>(Lifelink Health Providers, Inc</u></em><u>.)</u>&nbsp; (&ldquo;Agency&rdquo;) employees, contractors and physicians may use electronic signatures on all computer generated documentation &ldquo;Documentation&rdquo;. An electronic signature shall serve as authentication on patient and HR record documents and other Agency documents generated in Agency&rsquo;s Software Program. I acknowledge my use of the Electronic Signature Password (&ldquo;ESP&rdquo;) and my Login (&ldquo;Login&rdquo;) shall serve as my binding legal signature for the purpose of computerized medical records and other Documentation for Agency purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that the Agency Administrator shall issue each employee a unique Login, system password for authentication, and initial ESP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that the Agency may require scheduled resets of the ESP as directed by Agency policy. The Agency shall also have the ability to reset the password at its own discretion.&nbsp; I further understand that the ESP may be reset at my discretion given compliance to Agency policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that prior to submitting Documentation to the Agency, I shall review and authenticate, by use of electronic signature, my Documentation on the field-based or office computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that certain Documentation may not require electronic signature until required information has been obtained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that I shall not divulge my login, login password, and ESP, and that I must exit the Agency&rsquo;s Software Program at the end of each working day, at the completion of work, and whenever the computer is not in my immediate possession. I shall type in, rather than save, the login password that allows me access to the Agency&rsquo;s Software Program, and my ESP. I understand further that violation of Agency policy pertaining to security and confidentiality of patient information are grounds for suspension and/or termination of employment/contract.</p>
